"Strong authentication controls, such as the use of multifactor authentication, may be circumvented if basic authentication is used by Exchange Online email clients such as Outlook 2016 and Outlook 2013. Enabling modern authentication for Exchange Online ensures strong authentication mechanisms are used when establishing sessions between email clients and Exchange Online.",Low
A blocked account is a good indication that the account in question has been breached and an attacker is using it to send spam emails to other people.,Low
"By enabling DKIM with Office 365, messages that are sent from Exchange Online will be cryptographically signed. This will allow the receiving email system to validate that the messages were generated by a server that the organization authorized and not being spoofed.",Medium
"By categorizing and applying policy-based protection, SharePoint Online Data Classification Policies can help reduce the risk of data loss or exposure, and enable more effective incident response if a breach does occur.",Medium
"Attackers often spend time learning about organizations before launching an attack. Publicly available calendars can help attackers understand organizational relationships and determine when specific users may be more vulnerable to an attack, such as when they are traveling.",Medium
"Attackers often create these rules to exfiltrate data from your tenancy, this could be accomplished via access to an end-user account or otherwise. An insider could also use one of these methods as an secondary channel to exfiltrate sensitive data.",Medium
Enforcing the default ensures auditing was not turned off intentionally or accidentally. Auditing mailbox actions will allow forensics and IR teams to trace various malicious activities that can generate TTPs caused by inbox access and tampering,Medium
"Enabling DLP policies alerts users and administrators that specific types of data should not be exposed, helping to protect the data from accidental exposure.",Medium
"Whether it is for regulatory compliance or for tracking unauthorized configuration changes in Microsoft 365, enabling mailbox auditing, and ensuring the proper mailbox actions are accounted for allows for Microsoft 365 teams to run security operations, forensics or general investigations on mailbox activities",Medium
"By default additional storage providers are allowed in Office on the Web (such as Box, Dropbox, Facebook, Google Drive, OneDrive Personal, etc.). This could lead to information leakage and additional risk of infection from organizational non-trusted storage providers. Restricting this will inherently reduce risk as it will narrow opportunities for infection and data leakage.",High
Tagging emails from external senders helps to inform end users about the origin of the email. This can allow them to proceed with more caution and make informed decisions when it comes to identifying spam or phishing emails.,High
"Dynamic Groups allow for an automated method to assign group membership. Guest user accounts will be automatically added to this group and through this existing conditional access rules, access controls and other security measures will ensure that new guest accounts are restricted in the same manner as existing guest accounts.",Low

Enabling security alert emails ensures that security alert emails are received from Microsoft. This ensures that the right people are aware of any potential security issues and are able to mitigate the risk.,Low
"Ensure that only organizationally managed and approved public groups exist. When a group has a 'Public' privacy, users may access data related to this group. Administrators are notified when a user uses the Azure Portal. Requesting access to the group forces users to send a message to the group owner, but they still have immediately access to the group. The SharePoint URL is usually guessable, and can be found from the Group application of the Access Panel. If group privacy is not controlled, any user may access sensitive information, according to the group they try to access.",Low
"Azure SQL Server includes a firewall to block access to unauthorized connections. More granular IP addresses can be defined by referencing the range of addresses available from specific datacenters. By default, for a SQL server, a Firewall exists with StartIp of 0.0.0.0 and EndIP of 0.0.0.0 allowing access to all the Azure services. Additionally, a custom rule can be set up with StartIp of 0.0.0.0 and EndIP of 255.255.255.255 allowing access from ANY IP over the Internet.

"The secure transfer option enhances the security of a storage account by only allowing requests to the storage account by a secure connection. For example, when calling REST APIs to access storage accounts, the connection must use HTTPS. Any requests using HTTP will be rejected when 'secure transfer required' is enabled. When using the Azure files service, connection without encryption will fail, including scenarios using SMB 2.1, SMB 3.0 without encryption, and some flavors of the Linux SMB client. Because Azure storage doesnâ€™t support HTTPS for custom domain names, this option is not applied when using a custom domain name.",Low
IoT devices are very rarely patched and can be potential attack vectors for enterprise networks. Updating their network configuration to use a central security hub allows for detection of these breaches,Low
"Disabling Cross Tenant Replication minimizes the risk of unauthorized data access and ensures that data governance policies are strictly adhered to. This control is especially critical for organizations with stringent data security and privacy requirements, as it prevents the accidental sharing of sensitive information.",Low
TLS 1.0 has known vulnerabilities and has been replaced by later versions of the TLS protocol. Continued use of this legacy protocol affects the security of data in transit.,Low
"By default, data in the storage account is encrypted using Microsoft Managed Keys at rest. All Azure Storage resources are encrypted, including blobs, disks, files, queues, and tables. All object metadata is also encrypted. If you want to control and manage this encryption key yourself, however, you can specify a customer-managed key. That key is used to protect and control access to the key that encrypts your data. You can also choose to automatically update the key version used for Azure Storage encryption whenever a new version is available in the associated Key Vault.",Low

"Guest users in the Azure AD are generally required for collaboration purposes in Office 365, and may also be required for Azure functions in enterprises with multiple Azure tenants. Guest users should be reviewed on a regular basis, at least annually. Guest users should not be granted administrative roles where possible. Guest users are typically added outside your employee on-boarding/off-boarding process and could potentially be overlooked indefinitely, leading to a potential vulnerability. Guest users should be reviewed on a monthly basis to ensure that inactive and unneeded accounts are removed.",Medium
Microsoft Defender for Cloud emails the Subscription Owner to notify them about security alerts. Adding your Security Contact's email address to the 'Additional email addresses' field ensures that your organization's Security Team is included in these alerts. This ensures that the proper people are aware of any potential compromise in order to mitigate the risk in a timely fashion.,Medium
"Creating a new password can be difficult regardless of one's technical background. It is common to look around one's environment for suggestions when building a password, however, this may include picking words specific to the organization as inspiration for a password. An adversary may employ what is called a 'mangler' to create permutations of these specific words in an attempt to crack passwords or hashes making it easier to reach their goal.",Medium
"Enabling this gives your organization further customization on what secure passwords are allowed. Setting a bad password list enables your organization to fine-tune its password policy further, depending on your needs. Removing easy-to-guess passwords increases the security of access to your Azure resources",Medium
User notification on password reset is a proactive way of confirming password reset activity. It helps the user to recognize unauthorized password reset activities.,Medium
"Remembering Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for devices and browsers allows users to have the option to bypass MFA for a set number of days after performing a successful sign-in using MFA. This can enhance usability by minimizing the number of times a user may need to perform two-step verification on the same device. However, if an account or device is compromised, remembering MFA for trusted devices may affect security. Hence, it is recommended that users not be allowed to bypass MFA.",Medium
"If Microsoft Entra ID is running as an identity provider for third-party applications, permissions and consent should be limited to administrators or pre-approved. Malicious applications may attempt to exfiltrate data or abuse privileged user accounts",Medium
Legacy authentication protocols do not support multi-factor authentication. These protocols are often used by attackers because of this deficiency. Blocking legacy authentication makes it harder for attackers to gain access.,High
Sophisticated attacks targeting MFA are more prevalent as the use of it becomes more widespread. These 3 methods are considered phishing-resistant as they remove passwords from the login workflow. It also ensures that public/private key exchange can only happen between the devices and a registered provider which prevents login to fake or phishing websites..,High
"As the use of strong authentication has become more widespread, attackers have started to exploit the tendency of users to experience 'MFA fatigue.' This occurs when users are repeatedly asked to provide additional forms of identification, leading them to eventually approve requests without fully verifying the source. To counteract this, number matching can be employed to ensure the security of the authentication process. With this method, users are prompted to confirm a number displayed on their original device and enter it into the device being used for MFA. Additionally, other information such as geolocation and application details are displayed to enhance the end user's awareness. Among these 3 options, number matching provides the strongest net security gain.",High
"Multifactor authentication requires an individual to present a minimum of two separate forms of authentication before access is granted. Multifactor authentication provides additional assurance that the individual attempting to gain access is who they claim to be. With multifactor authentication, an attacker would need to compromise at least two different authentication mechanisms, increasing the difficulty of compromise and thus reducing the risk.",High

"Both security defaults and conditional access with security defaults turned off are not compatible with per-user multi-factor authentication (MFA), which can lead to undesirable user authentication states. The CIS Microsoft 365 Benchmark explicitly employs Conditional Access for MFA as an enhancement over security defaults and as a replacement for the outdated per-user MFA. To ensure a consistent authentication state disable per-user MFA on all accounts.",High
"Limiting guest access ensures that guest accounts do not have permission for certain directory tasks, such as enumerating users, groups or other directory resources, and cannot be assigned to administrative roles in your directory. Guest access has three levels of restriction. 1. Guest users have the same access as members (most inclusive)  2. Guest users have limited access to properties and memberships of directory objects 3. Guest user access is restricted to properties and memberships of their own directory objects The recommended option is the 3rd, most restrictive: 'Guest user access is restricted to their own directory object'",High
"Global Administrator accounts are sensitive. Any password reset activity notification, when sent to all Global Administrators, ensures that all Global administrators can passively confirm if such a reset is a common pattern within their group. For example, if all Global Administrators change their password every 30 days, any password reset activity before that may require administrator(s) to evaluate any unusual activity and confirm its origin.",High
It is recommended to only allow an administrator to register custom-developed applications. This ensures that the application undergoes a formal security review and approval process prior to exposing Microsoft Entra ID data. Certain users like developers or other high-request users may also be delegated permissions to prevent them from waiting on an administrative user. Your organization should review your policies and decide your needs.,High

"Third party integrated applications connection to services should be disabled, unless there is a very clear value and robust security controls are in place. While there are legitimate uses, attackers can grant access from breached accounts to third party applications to exfiltrate data from your tenancy without having to maintain the breached account.",High
It is recommended to only allow an administrator to create new tenants. This prevent users from creating new Azure AD or Azure AD B2C tenants and ensures that only authorized users are able to do so.,High
"Restricting tenant creation prevents unauthorized or uncontrolled deployment of resources and ensures that the organization retains control over its infrastructure. User generation of shadow IT could lead to multiple, disjointed environments that can make it difficult for IT to manage and secure the organization's data, especially if other users in the organization began using these tenants for business purposes under the misunderstanding that they were secured by the organization's security team.",High
"Restricting invitations to users with specific administrator roles ensures that only authorized accounts have access to cloud resources. This helps to maintain 'Need to Know' permissions and prevents inadvertent access to data. By default the setting Guest invite restrictions is set to Anyone in the organization can invite guest users including guests and non-admins. This would allow anyone within the organization to invite guests and non-admins to the tenant, posing a security risk.",High
Permissions to move subscriptions in and out of Microsoft Entra ID must only be given to appropriate administrative personnel. A subscription that is moved into an Microsoft Entra ID directory may be within a folder to which other users have elevated permissions. This prevents loss of data or unapproved changes of the objects within by potential bad actors.,High
"Blocking sign-in to Azure Management applications and portals enhances security of sensitive data by restricting access to privileged users. This mitigates potential exposure due to administrative errors or software vulnerabilities, as well as acting as a defense in depth measure against security breaches.",High
"Forcing a time out for MFA will help ensure that sessions are not kept alive for an indefinite period of time, ensuring that browser sessions are not persistent will help in prevention of drive-by attacks in web browsers, this also prevents creation and saving of session cookies leaving nothing for an attacker to take.",High

Requiring modern authentication for SharePoint applications ensures strong authentication mechanisms are used when establishing sessions between these applications, SharePoint, and connecting users.",High
By increasing the frequency of times guests need to reauthenticate this ensures guest user access to data is not prolonged beyond an acceptable amount of time.,High
"External users assigned guest accounts will be subject to Azure AD access policies, such as multi-factor authentication. This provides a way to manage guest identities and control access to SharePoint and OneDrive resources. Without this integration, files can be shared without account registration, making it more challenging to audit and manage who has access to the organization's data.",High

Disable external sharing of Sway documents that can contain sensitive information to prevent accidental or arbitrary data leak.,Low
"Organizations such as NIST and Microsoft have updated their password policy recommendations to not arbitrarily require users to change their passwords after a specific amount of time, unless there is evidence that the password is compromised or the user forgot it. They suggest this even for single factor (Password Only) use cases, with a reasoning that forcing arbitrary password changes on users actually make the passwords less secure. Other recommendations within this Benchmark suggest the use of MFA authentication for at least critical accounts (at minimum), which makes password expiration even less useful as well as password protection for Azure AD..",Low
"Ending idle sessions through an automatic process can help protect sensitive company data, and will add another layer of security for end users who work on unmanaged devices that can potentially be accessed by the public. Unauthorized individuals onsite or remotely can take advantage of systems left unattended over time. Automatic timing out of sessions makes this more difficult.",Medium
"By using external storage services an organization may increases the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access to confidential information. Additionally, third-party services may not adhere to the same security standards as the organization, making it difficult to maintain data privacy and security.",High
"Attackers commonly use vulnerable and custom-built add-ins to access data in user applications. While allowing users to install add-ins by themselves does allow them to easily acquire useful add-ins that integrate with Microsoft applications, it can represent a risk if not used and monitored carefully. Disable future user's ability to install add-ins in Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint helps reduce your threat-surface and mitigate this risk.",High
"Ensuring administrative accounts are cloud-only, without applications assigned to them will reduce the attack surface of high privileged identities in your environment. In order to participate in Microsoft 365 security services such as Identity Protection, PIM and Conditional Access an administrative account will need a license attached to it.
