Title,Description,RiskRating
Multi-Factor Auth Status is 'Disabled' for some privileged Users,"Multi-factor authentication requires an individual to present a minimum of two separate forms of authentication before access is granted. Multi-factor authentication provides additional assurance that the individual attempting to gain access is who they claim to be. With multi-factor authentication, an attacker would need to compromise at least two different authentication mechanisms, increasing the difficulty of compromise and thus reducing the risk.",Critical
Less than 2 emergency access accounts have been defined,"In various situations, an organization may require the use of a break glass account to gain emergency access. In the event of losing access to administrative functions, an organization may experience a significant loss in its ability to provide support, lose insight into its security posture, and potentially suffer financial losses.",High
Email from external senders cannot be identified,Tagging emails from external senders helps to inform end users about the origin of the email. This can allow them to proceed with more caution and make informed decisions when it comes to identifying spam or phishing emails.,High
'Subscription Entering AAD Directory' and 'Subscription Leaving AAD Directory' Are Set to Everyone!,Permissions to move subscriptions in and out of Microsoft Entra ID must only be given to appropriate administrative personnel. A subscription that is moved into an Microsoft Entra ID directory may be within a folder to which other users have elevated permissions. This prevents loss of data or unapproved changes of the objects within by potential bad actors.,High
Non-Admin Users can create new tenants!,"Restricting tenant creation prevents unauthorized or uncontrolled deployment of resources and ensures that the organization retains control over its infrastructure. User generation of shadow IT could lead to multiple, disjointed environments that can make it difficult for IT to manage and secure the organization's data, especially if other users in the organization began using these tenants for business purposes under the misunderstanding that they were secured by the organization's security team.",High
Restrict non-admin users from creating tenants is set to No,It is recommended to only allow an administrator to create new tenants. This prevent users from creating new Azure AD or Azure AD B2C tenants and ensures that only authorized users are able to do so.,High
Third party integrated applications are allowed!,"Third party integrated applications connection to services should be disabled, unless there is a very clear value and robust security controls are in place. While there are legitimate uses, attackers can grant access from breached accounts to third party applications to exfiltrate data from your tenancy without having to maintain the breached account.",High
User consent for applications is not set to: 'Do not allow user consent' or 'Allow for Verified Publishers',"If Microsoft Entra ID is running as an identity provider for third-party applications, permissions and consent should be limited to administrators or pre-approved. Malicious applications may attempt to exfiltrate data or abuse privileged user accounts.",High
Users Can Register Applications Is Set to 'Yes',It is recommended to only allow an administrator to register custom-developed applications. This ensures that the application undergoes a formal security review and approval process prior to exposing Microsoft Entra ID data. Certain users like developers or other high-request users may also be delegated permissions to prevent them from waiting on an administrative user. Your organization should review your policies and decide your needs.,High
Notify all admins when other admins reset their password?' is set to 'No',"Global Administrator accounts are sensitive. Any password reset activity notification, when sent to all Global Administrators, ensures that all Global administrators can passively confirm if such a reset is a common pattern within their group. For example, if all Global Administrators change their password every 30 days, any password reset activity before that may require administrator(s) to evaluate any unusual activity and confirm its origin.",High
Some User Accounts do not have MFA enabled,"Both security defaults and conditional access with security defaults turned off are not compatible with per-user multi-factor authentication (MFA), which can lead to undesirable user authentication states. The CIS Microsoft 365 Benchmark explicitly employs Conditional Access for MFA as an enhancement over security defaults and as a replacement for the outdated per-user MFA. To ensure a consistent authentication state disable per-user MFA on all accounts.",High
Multi-Factor Auth Status is 'Disabled' for some non-privileged Users,"Multi-factor authentication requires an individual to present a minimum of two separate forms of authentication before access is granted. Multi-factor authentication provides additional assurance that the individual attempting to gain access is who they claim to be. With multi-factor authentication, an attacker would need to compromise at least two different authentication mechanisms, increasing the difficulty of compromise and thus reducing the risk",High

Multifactor authentication provides additional assurance that the individual attempting to gain access is who they claim to be. With multifactor authentication, an attacker would need to compromise at least two different authentication mechanisms, increasing the difficulty of compromise and thus reducing the risk.",High
Microsoft Authenticator is not configured to protect against MFA fatigue,"As the use of strong authentication has become more widespread, attackers have started to exploit the tendency of users to experience 'MFA fatigue.' This occurs when users are repeatedly asked to provide additional forms of identification, leading them to eventually approve requests without fully verifying the source. To counteract this, number matching can be employed to ensure the security of the authentication process. With this method, users are prompted to confirm a number displayed on their original device and enter it into the device being used for MFA. Additionally, other information such as geolocation and application details are displayed to enhance the end user's awareness. Among these 3 options, number matching provides the strongest net security gain.",High
Phishing-resistant MFA strength must be required for Administrators,Sophisticated attacks targeting MFA are more prevalent as the use of it becomes more widespread. These 3 methods are considered phishing-resistant as they remove passwords from the login workflow. It also ensures that public/private key exchange can only happen between the devices and a registered provider which prevents login to fake or phishing websites..,High
No Conditional Access policies to block legacy authentication,Legacy authentication protocols do not support multi-factor authentication. These protocols are often used by attackers because of this deficiency. Blocking legacy authentication makes it harder for attackers to gain access.,High
Guest users access restrictions is not set to 'Guest user access is restricted to properties and memberships of their own directory objects',"Limiting guest access ensures that guest accounts do not have permission for certain directory tasks, such as enumerating users, groups or other directory resources, and cannot be assigned to administrative roles in your directory. Guest access has three levels of restriction. 1. Guest users have the same access as members (most inclusive)  2. Guest users have limited access to properties and memberships of directory objects 3. Guest user access is restricted to properties and memberships of their own directory objects The recommended option is the 3rd, most restrictive: 'Guest user access is restricted to their own directory object'",High
Additional storage providers are not restricted in Outlook on the Web,"By default additional storage providers are allowed in Office on the Web (such as Box, Dropbox, Facebook, Google Drive, OneDrive Personal, etc.). This could lead to information leakage and additional risk of infection from organizational non-trusted storage providers. Restricting this will inherently reduce risk as it will narrow opportunities for infection and data leakage.",High
Guest invite restrictions is not set to 'Only users assigned to specific admin roles can invite guest users',"Restricting invitations to users with specific administrator roles ensures that only authorized accounts have access to cloud resources. This helps to maintain 'Need to Know' permissions and prevents inadvertent access to data. By default the setting Guest invite restrictions is set to Anyone in the organization can invite guest users including guests and non-admins. This would allow anyone within the organization to invite guests and non-admins to the tenant, posing a security risk.",High
Ensure Sign-in frequency is enabled and browser sessions are not persistent for Administrative users,"Forcing a time out for MFA will help ensure that sessions are not kept alive for an indefinite period of time, ensuring that browser sessions are not persistent will help in prevention of drive-by attacks in web browsers, this also prevents creation and saving of session cookies leaving nothing for an attacker to take.",High
External participants can give or request control,Ensuring that only authorized individuals and not external participants are able to present and request control reduces the risk that a malicious user can inadvertently show content that is not appropriate.,High
Users cannot report security concerns in Teams,Users will be able to more quickly and systematically alert administrators of suspicious malicious messages within Teams. The content of these messages may be sensitive in nature and therefore should be kept within the organization and not shared with Microsoft without first consulting company policy.,High
Anonymous users can join a meeting,"For meetings that could contain sensitive information, it is best to allow the meeting organizer to vet anyone not directly sent an invite before admitting them to the meeting. This will also prevent the anonymous user from using the meeting link to have meetings at unscheduled times",High
"Not only organizers and co-organizers can present, but also other users",Ensuring that only authorized individuals are able to present reduces the risk that a malicious user can inadvertently show content that is not appropriate.,High
Ensure Microsoft Azure Management is limited to administrative roles,"Blocking sign-in to Azure Management applications and portals enhances security of sensitive data by restricting access to privileged users. This mitigates potential exposure due to administrative errors or software vulnerabilities, as well as acting as a defense in depth measure against security breaches.",High
Users can send emails to a channel emailaddress,Channel email addresses are not under the tenant's domain and organizations do not have control over the security settings for this email address. An attacker could email channels directly if they discover the channel email address.,High
The meeting chat allows anonymous users,Ensuring that only authorized individuals can read and write chat messages during a meeting reduces the risk that a malicious user can inadvertently show content that is not appropriate or view sensitive information.,High
Users dialing in can bypass the lobby,"For meetings that could contain sensitive information, it is best to allow the meeting organizer to vet anyone not directly from the organization.",High
Everyone can bypass the lobby,"For meetings that could contain sensitive information, it is best to allow the meeting organizer to vet anyone not directly sent an invite before admitting them to the meeting. This will also prevent the anonymous user from using the meeting link to have meetings at unscheduled times.",High
'third-party storage services' are not restricted in 'Microsoft 365 on the web',"By using external storage services an organization may increases the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access to confidential information. Additionally, third-party services may not adhere to the same security standards as the organization, making it difficult to maintain data privacy and security.",High
SharePoint and OneDrive integration with Azure AD B2B is not enabled!,"External users assigned guest accounts will be subject to Azure AD access policies, such as multi-factor authentication.

Modern Authentication for Microsoft Sharepoint is disabled!,"Strong authentication controls, such as the use of multifactor authentication, may be circumvented if basic authentication is used by SharePoint applications. Requiring modern authentication for SharePoint applications ensures strong authentication mechanisms are used when establishing sessions between these applications, SharePoint, and connecting users.",High
Guest access to a site or OneDrive does not expire automatically,This setting ensures that guests who no longer need access to the site or link no longer have access after a set period of time. Allowing guest access for an indefinite amount of time could lead to loss of data confidentiality and oversight.,High
User owned apps and services are not restricted,"Attackers commonly use vulnerable and custom-built add-ins to access data in user applications. While allowing users to install add-ins by themselves does allow them to easily acquire useful add-ins that integrate with Microsoft applications, it can represent a risk if not used and monitored carefully. Disable future user's ability to install add-ins in Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint helps reduce your threat-surface and mitigate this risk.",High
 Ensure Administrative accounts are separate and cloud-only,"Ensuring administrative accounts are cloud-only, without applications assigned to them will reduce the attack surface of high privileged identities in your environment. In order to participate in Microsoft 365 security services such as Identity Protection, PIM and Conditional Access an administrative account will need a license attached to it. Ensure that the license used does not include any applications with potentially vulnerable services by using either Microsoft Entra ID P1 or Microsoft Entra ID P2 for the cloud-only account with administrator roles.",High
Idle Session Timeout for unmanaged devices is not set to 3 hours or less!,"Ending idle sessions through an automatic process can help protect sensitive company data, and will add another layer of security for end users who work on unmanaged devices that can potentially be accessed by the public. Unauthorized individuals onsite or remotely can take advantage of systems left unattended over time. Automatic timing out of sessions makes this more difficult.",Medium
User consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf is allowed!,"Attackers commonly use custom applications to trick users into granting them access to company data. Disabling future user consent operations setting mitigates this risk, and helps to reduce the threat-surface. If user consent is disabled previous consent grants will still be honored but all future consent operations must be performed by an administrator.",Medium

Malicious applications may attempt to exfiltrate data or abuse privileged user accounts",Medium
Allow users to remember multi-factor authentication on devices they trust is Enabled,"Remembering Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for devices and browsers allows users to have the option to bypass MFA for a set number of days after performing a successful sign-in using MFA. This can enhance usability by minimizing the number of times a user may need to perform two-step verification on the same device. However, if an account or device is compromised, remembering MFA for trusted devices may affect security. Hence, it is recommended that users not be allowed to bypass MFA.",Medium
'Notify users on password resets?' is set to 'No',User notification on password reset is a proactive way of confirming password reset activity. It helps the user to recognize unauthorized password reset activities.,Medium
No Custom Bad Password List is set to 'Enforce' for your Organization,"Enabling this gives your organization further customization on what secure passwords are allowed. Setting a bad password list enables your organization to fine-tune its password policy further, depending on your needs. Removing easy-to-guess passwords increases the security of access to your Azure resources",Medium
No Custom Bad Password List is used within your organization,"Creating a new password can be difficult regardless of one's technical background. It is common to look around one's environment for suggestions when building a password, however, this may include picking words specific to the organization as inspiration for a password. An adversary may employ what is called a 'mangler' to create permutations of these specific words in an attempt to crack passwords or hashes making it easier to reach their goal.",Medium
Additional email addresses is not Configured with any Security Contact Email,Microsoft Defender for Cloud emails the Subscription Owner to notify them about security alerts. Adding your Security Contact's email address to the 'Additional email addresses' field ensures that your organization's Security Team is included in these alerts.

Guest Users Must be Reviewed on a Regular Basis,"Guest users in the Azure AD are generally required for collaboration purposes in Office 365, and may also be required for Azure functions in enterprises with multiple Azure tenants. Guest users should be reviewed on a regular basis, at least annually. Guest users should not be granted administrative roles where possible. Guest users are typically added outside your employee on-boarding/off-boarding process and could potentially be overlooked indefinitely, leading to a potential vulnerability. Guest users should be reviewed on a monthly basis to ensure that inactive and unneeded accounts are removed.",Medium
External access is not restricted in the Teams admin center!,"Allowing users to communicate with Skype or Teams users outside of an organization presents a potential security threat as external users can interact with organization users over Skype for Business or Teams. While legitimate, productivity-improving scenarios exist, they are outweighed by the risk of data loss, phishing, and social engineering attacks against organization users via Teams. Therefore, it is recommended to restrict external communications in order to minimize the risk of security incidents.",Medium
