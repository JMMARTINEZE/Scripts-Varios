Title,Description,RiskRating
MultiFactor Authentication (MFA) is not enabled for all users in administrative roles,"Multifactor authentication requires an individual to present a minimum of two separate forms of authentication before access is granted. Multifactor authentication provides additional assurance that the individual attempting to gain access is who they claim to be. With multifactor authentication, an attacker would need to compromise at least two different authentication mechanisms, increasing the difficulty of compromise and thus reducing the risk.",Critical
Multi-Factor Auth Status is 'Disabled' for some privileged Users,"Multi-factor authentication requires an individual to present a minimum of two separate forms of authentication before access is granted. Multi-factor authentication provides additional assurance that the individual attempting to gain access is who they claim to be. With multi-factor authentication, an attacker would need to compromise at least two different authentication mechanisms, increasing the difficulty of compromise and thus reducing the risk.",Critical
Users Can Register Applications Is Set to 'Yes',It is recommended to only allow an administrator to register custom-developed applications. This ensures that the application undergoes a formal security review and approval process prior to exposing Microsoft Entra ID data. Certain users like developers or other high-request users may also be delegated permissions to prevent them from waiting on an administrative user. Your organization should review your policies and decide your needs.,High
There are 1 global admins designated,"If there is only one global tenant administrator, he or she can perform malicious activity without the possibility of being discovered by another admin. If there are numerous global tenant administrators, the more likely it is that one of their accounts will be successfully breached by an external attacker.",High
Microsoft Authenticator is not configured to protect against MFA fatigue,"As the use of strong authentication has become more widespread, attackers have started to exploit the tendency of users to experience 'MFA fatigue.' This occurs when users are repeatedly asked to provide additional forms of identification, leading them to eventually approve requests without fully verifying the source. To counteract this, number matching can be employed to ensure the security of the authentication process. With this method, users are prompted to confirm a number displayed on their original device and enter it into the device being used for MFA. Additionally, other information such as geolocation and application details are displayed to enhance the end user's awareness. Among these 3 options, number matching provides the strongest net security gain.",High
"Users can create security groups in Azure portals, API or PowerShell","When creating security groups is enabled, all users in the directory are allowed to create new security groups and add members to those groups. Unless a business requires this day-to-day delegation, security group creation should be restricted to administrators only.",High
Multi-Factor Auth Status is 'Disabled' for some non-privileged Users,"Multi-factor authentication requires an individual to present a minimum of two separate forms of authentication before access is granted. Multi-factor authentication provides additional assurance that the individual attempting to gain access is who they claim to be. With multi-factor authentication, an attacker would need to compromise at least two different authentication mechanisms, increasing the difficulty of compromise and thus reducing the risk",High
Notify all admins when other admins reset their password?' is set to 'No',"Global Administrator accounts are sensitive. Any password reset activity notification, when sent to all Global Administrators, ensures that all Global administrators can passively confirm if such a reset is a common pattern within their group. For example, if all Global Administrators change their password every 30 days, any password reset activity before that may require administrator(s) to evaluate any unusual activity and confirm its origin.",High
Some User Accounts do not have MFA enabled,"Both security defaults and conditional access with security defaults turned off are not compatible with per-user multi-factor authentication (MFA), which can lead to undesirable user authentication states. The CIS Microsoft 365 Benchmark explicitly employs Conditional Access for MFA as an enhancement over security defaults and as a replacement for the outdated per-user MFA. To ensure a consistent authentication state disable per-user MFA on all accounts.",High
There are less than 1 or more than 5 users with an global administrator assignment,"The Global Administrator role has extensive privileges across all services in Microsoft Entra ID. The Global Administrator role should never be used in regular daily activities; administrators should have a regular user account for daily activities, and a separate account for administrative responsibilities. Limiting the number of Global Administrators helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, reduces the potential impact of human error, and aligns with the principle of least privilege to reduce the attack surface of an Azure tenant. Conversely, having at least two Global Administrators ensures that administrative functions can be performed without interruption in case of unavailability of a single admin.",High
User consent for applications is not set to: 'Do not allow user consent' or 'Allow for Verified Publishers',"If Microsoft Entra ID is running as an identity provider for third-party applications, permissions and consent should be limited to administrators or pre-approved. Malicious applications may attempt to exfiltrate data or abuse privileged user accounts.",High
Third party integrated applications are allowed!,"Third party integrated applications connection to services should be disabled, unless there is a very clear value and robust security controls are in place. While there are legitimate uses, attackers can grant access from breached accounts to third party applications to exfiltrate data from your tenancy without having to maintain the breached account.",High
Ensure Sign-in frequency is enabled and browser sessions are not persistent for Administrative users,"Forcing a time out for MFA will help ensure that sessions are not kept alive for an indefinite period of time, ensuring that browser sessions are not persistent will help in prevention of drive-by attacks in web browsers, this also prevents creation and saving of session cookies leaving nothing for an attacker to take.",High
Verify if you have an Azure AD Identity Proteciton user risk policy enabled,"With the user risk policy turned on, Azure AD detects the probability that a user account has been compromised. Administrators can configure a user risk conditional access policy to automatically respond to a specific user risk level.",High
MultiFactor Authentication (MFA) is not enabled for all users non-administrative roles,"Multifactor authentication requires an individual to present a minimum of two separate forms of authentication before access is granted. Multifactor authentication provides additional assurance that the individual attempting to gain access is who they claim to be. With multifactor authentication, an attacker would need to compromise at least two different authentication mechanisms, increasing the difficulty of compromise and thus reducing the risk.",High
Restrict non-admin users from creating tenants is set to No,It is recommended to only allow an administrator to create new tenants. This prevent users from creating new Azure AD or Azure AD B2C tenants and ensures that only authorized users are able to do so.,High
Access to the Azure AD administration portal is not restricted!,"The Azure AD administrative (AAD) portal contains sensitive data and permission settings, which are still enforced based on the user's role. However, an end user may inadvertently change properties or account settings that could result in increased administrative overhead. Additionally, a compromised end user account could be used by a malicious attacker as a means to gather additional information and escalate an attack.",High
Non-Admin Users can create new tenants!,"Restricting tenant creation prevents unauthorized or uncontrolled deployment of resources and ensures that the organization retains control over its infrastructure. User generation of shadow IT could lead to multiple, disjointed environments that can make it difficult for IT to manage and secure the organization's data, especially if other users in the organization began using these tenants for business purposes under the misunderstanding that they were secured by the organization's security team.",High
'Restrict access to Azure AD administration portal is set to 'No',The Microsoft Entra ID administrative portal has sensitive data and permission settings. All non-administrators should be prohibited from accessing any Entra ID data in the administration portal to avoid exposure,High
Guest invite restrictions is not set to 'Only users assigned to specific admin roles can invite guest users',"Restricting invitations to users with specific administrator roles ensures that only authorized accounts have access to cloud resources. This helps to maintain 'Need to Know' permissions and prevents inadvertent access to data. By default the setting Guest invite restrictions is set to Anyone in the organization can invite guest users including guests and non-admins. This would allow anyone within the organization to invite guests and non-admins to the tenant, posing a security risk.",High
Ensure Microsoft Azure Management is limited to administrative roles,"Blocking sign-in to Azure Management applications and portals enhances security of sensitive data by restricting access to privileged users. This mitigates potential exposure due to administrative errors or software vulnerabilities, as well as acting as a defense in depth measure against security breaches.",High
'third-party storage services' are not restricted in 'Microsoft 365 on the web',"By using external storage services an organization may increases the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access to confidential information. Additionally, third-party services may not adhere to the same security standards as the organization, making it difficult to maintain data privacy and security.",High
User owned apps and services are not restricted,"Attackers commonly use vulnerable and custom-built add-ins to access data in user applications. While allowing users to install add-ins by themselves does allow them to easily acquire useful add-ins that integrate with Microsoft applications, it can represent a risk if not used and monitored carefully. Disable future user's ability to install add-ins in Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint helps reduce your threat-surface and mitigate this risk.",High
 Ensure Administrative accounts are separate and cloud-only,"Ensuring administrative accounts are cloud-only, without applications assigned to them will reduce the attack surface of high privileged identities in your environment. In order to participate in Microsoft 365 security services such as Identity Protection, PIM and Conditional Access an administrative account will need a license attached to it. Ensure that the license used does not include any applications with potentially vulnerable services by using either Microsoft Entra ID P1 or Microsoft Entra ID P2 for the cloud-only account with administrator roles.",High
Verify if you have an Azure AD Identity Protection sign-in risk policy enabled,Turning on the sign-in risk policy ensures that suspicious sign-ins are challenged for multi-factor authentication.,High
Not all member users are 'MFA capable',"Multifactor authentication requires an individual to present a minimum of two separate forms of authentication before access is granted. Users who are not MFA Capable have never registered a strong authentication method for multifactor authentication that is within policy and may not be using MFA. This could be a result of having never signed in, exclusion from a Conditional Access (CA) policy requiring MFA, or a CA policy does not exist. Reviewing this list of users will help identify possible lapses in policy or procedure",High
Less than 2 emergency access accounts have been defined,"In various situations, an organization may require the use of a break glass account to gain emergency access. In the event of losing access to administrative functions, an organization may experience a significant loss in its ability to provide support, lose insight into its security posture, and potentially suffer financial losses.",High
Phishing-resistant MFA strength must be required for Administrators,Sophisticated attacks targeting MFA are more prevalent as the use of it becomes more widespread. These 3 methods are considered phishing-resistant as they remove passwords from the login workflow. It also ensures that public/private key exchange can only happen between the devices and a registered provider which prevents login to fake or phishing websites..,High
Safe Links for Office Applications is not Enabled!,"Enabling Safe Links policy for Office applications allows URL's that exist inside of Office documents and email applications opened by Office, Office Online and Office mobile to be processed against Defender for Office time-of-click verification and rewritten if required. Safe Links for Office applications extends phishing protection to documents and emails that contain hyperlinks, even after they have been delivered to a user.",High
Safe Attachments for Office Applications is not Enabled!,"Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams protects organizations from inadvertently sharing malicious files. When a malicious file is detected, that file is blocked so that no one can open, copy, move, or share it until further actions are taken by the organization's security team.",High
Guest users access restrictions is not set to 'Guest user access is restricted to properties and memberships of their own directory objects',"Limiting guest access ensures that guest accounts do not have permission for certain directory tasks, such as enumerating users, groups or other directory resources, and cannot be assigned to administrative roles in your directory. Guest access has three levels of restriction. 1. Guest users have the same access as members (most inclusive)  2. Guest users have limited access to properties and memberships of directory objects 3. Guest user access is restricted to properties and memberships of their own directory objects The recommended option is the 3rd, most restrictive: 'Guest user access is restricted to their own directory object'",High
Safe Attachments Not Enabled,"Enabling Safe Attachments policy helps protect against malware threats in email attachments by analyzing suspicious attachments in a secure, cloud-based environment before they are delivered to the user's inbox. This provides an additional layer of security and can prevent new or unseen types of malware from infiltrating the organization's network.",High
Priority accounts do not have 'Strict protection' presets applied,"Enabling priority account protection for users in Microsoft 365 is necessary to enhance security for accounts with access to sensitive data and high privileges, such as CEOs, CISOs, CFOs, and IT admins. These priority accounts are often targeted by spear phishing or whaling attacks and require stronger protection to prevent account compromise. To address this, Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 offer several key features that provide extra security, including the identification of incidents and alerts involving priority accounts and the use of built-in custom protections designed specifically for them.",High
Anti-Phishing policy not has been created,"Protects users from phishing attacks (like impersonation and spoofing), and uses safety tips to warn users about potentially harmful messages.",High
No Custom Bad Password List is used within your organization,"Creating a new password can be difficult regardless of one's technical background. It is common to look around one's environment for suggestions when building a password, however, this may include picking words specific to the organization as inspiration for a password. An adversary may employ what is called a 'mangler' to create permutations of these specific words in an attempt to crack passwords or hashes making it easier to reach their goal.",Medium
No Custom Bad Password List is set to 'Enforce' for your Organization,"Enabling this gives your organization further customization on what secure passwords are allowed. Setting a bad password list enables your organization to fine-tune its password policy further, depending on your needs. Removing easy-to-guess passwords increases the security of access to your Azure resources",Medium
User consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf is allowed!,"Attackers commonly use custom applications to trick users into granting them access to company data. Disabling future user consent operations setting mitigates this risk, and helps to reduce the threat-surface. If user consent is disabled previous consent grants will still be honored but all future consent operations must be performed by an administrator.",Medium
LinkedIn Account Connections is enabled!,Disabling LinkedIn integration prevents potential phishing attacks and risk scenarios where an external party could accidentally disclose sensitive information.,Medium
No SharePoint Online Data Classification Policies Set!,"By categorizing and applying policy-based protection, SharePoint Online Data Classification Policies can help reduce the risk of data loss or exposure, and enable more effective incident response if a breach does occur.",Medium
DLP Policy is not enabled!,"Enabling DLP policies alerts users and administrators that specific types of data should not be exposed, helping to protect the data from accidental exposure.",Medium
Verify if Priviledged Identity Management (PIM) is used to manage roles,"Organizations want to minimize the number of people who have access to secure information or resources, because that reduces the chance of a malicious actor getting that access, or an authorized user inadvertently impacting a sensitive resource. However, users still need to carry out privileged operations in Azure AD and Office 365. Organizations can give users just-in-time (JIT) privileged access to roles. There is a need for oversight for what those users are doing with their administrator privileges. PIM helps to mitigate the risk of excessive, unnecessary, or misused access rights.",Medium
Restrict user ability to access groups features in the Access Pane is Set to 'No',"Self-service group management enables users to create and manage security groups or Office 365 groups in Microsoft Entra ID. Unless a business requires this day-to-day delegation for some users, self-service group management should be disabled.",Medium
'Idle Session Timeout' for unmanaged devices is not set to 3 hours or less!,"Ending idle sessions through an automatic process can help protect sensitive company data, and will add another layer of security for end users who work on unmanaged devices that can potentially be accessed by the public. Unauthorized individuals onsite or remotely can take advantage of systems left unattended over time. Automatic timing out of sessions makes this more difficult.",Medium
Allow users to remember multi-factor authentication on devices they trust is Enabled,"Remembering Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for devices and browsers allows users to have the option to bypass MFA for a set number of days after performing a successful sign-in using MFA. This can enhance usability by minimizing the number of times a user may need to perform two-step verification on the same device. However, if an account or device is compromised, remembering MFA for trusted devices may affect security. Hence, it is recommended that users not be allowed to bypass MFA.",Medium
User consent for applications is not set to: 'Do not allow user consent',"If Microsoft Entra ID is running as an identity provider for third-party applications, permissions and consent should be limited to administrators or pre-approved. Malicious applications may attempt to exfiltrate data or abuse privileged user accounts",Medium
